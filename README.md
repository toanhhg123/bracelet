### Requirements

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev or yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: sitemap configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by uncommenting the following lines `src/app/layouts.tsx`:

```tsx
// export const runtime = 'edge';
```

### Deploy to production

Generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build or yarn build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. For testing the generated build, you can run:

```shell
$ npm run start or yarn start
```

The command starts a local server with the production build. Then, you can now open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see the project.

### Deploy to Netlify

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=)

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
